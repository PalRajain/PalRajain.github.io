    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">Service quality of late has emerged as the major attractant to many banks as a competitive differentiator. This study deals with service quality gaps in public banks as after nationalisation of several commercial banks competition was restricted but with the entry of new generation tech-savvy private banks the banking sector has become too competitive. For comparison, five service quality dimensions are used i.e. tangibility, reliability, assurance, responsiveness and empathy. The 22 items SERVQUAL scale based on gap model proposed by Parasuraman, Zeithmal and Berry was applied. Quota sampling was used and a sample size of 100 was taken. Gap analysis was applied to find the gaps between expected and performed service in public banks of NCR and t-test was administered using SPSS to find difference between male and female perception and expectation. The study provided an insight into which attributes of service quality in public banks were most important in providing satisfaction to customers and areas where significant gaps existed. From the present study it can be concluded that the highest gap was found in the dimension of tangibility and responsiveness. Also after applying t-test it was found that no significant difference exists between the perception and expectation of males and females respondents except a few dimensions of service quality of public banks.</p>
